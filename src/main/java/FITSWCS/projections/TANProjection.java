/**
 *   This class provides support for the gnomonic projection (TAN) used 
 *   by the FITS "World Coordinate System" (WCS) convention. <p>
 *
 *   The FITSWCS package was translated from the WCSLIB C library.
 *   This original library was written in support for coordinate 
 *   systems used by astronomical data stored in FITS format.  For more 
 *   information on these coordinate systems, refer to the paper by Greisen 
 *   and Calabretta at:
 *   <blockquote>
 *       ftp://fits.cv.nrao.edu/fits/documents/wcs/wcs.all.ps.Z 
 *   </blockquote>
 *
 *   <b> Nomenclature </b><p>
 *
 *   In WCSLIB the "forward" direction is from (lng,lat) celestial
 *   coordinates to (x,y) coordinates in the plane of projection.  This
 *   accords with the notion that spherical projections are a projection of
 *   the sphere onto a plane, the "reverse" direction is therefore that of
 *   deprojection from plane to sphere. <p>
 *   
 *   Unfortunately, this is opposite to what is generally understood to be
 *   the forward direction for FITS, namely that of transforming pixel
 *   coordinates to world coordinates.  However, the ordering of function
 *   argument lists should make it clear what is intended.<p>
 *   
 *   <b> Accuracy </b><p>
 *   
 *   Closure to a precision of at least 1.0-10 degree of longitude and latitude
 *   has been verified for typical projection parameters on the 1 degree grid
 *   of native longitude and latitude (to within 5 degrees of any latitude
 *   where the projection may diverge).
 *
 *   Notwithstanding this, absolutely no claim is made for the accuracy or
 *   reliability of these routines.  They are supplied as is, with no warranty
 *   of fitness for any purpose.
